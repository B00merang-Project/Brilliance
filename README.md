# Brilliance
(based on material by [RAVEfinity](https://www.ravefinity.com/p/our-themes-work.html))

Originally, Ambiance and Radiance Flat were a modern and vivid re-imagination of the Ambiance and Radiance themes.
In 2017, the RAVEfinity Open Source Design Project stopped all activities. Later, when a new version of GNOME was released, RAVEfinity themes turned out to be incompatible with the newer CSS engine.

We have taken upon ourselves to restore at least some part of the original RAVEfinity project themes, starting with the original Ambiance Flat Pack, which includes 13 different color variations. To avoid the huge maintenance workload that pushed RAVEfinity to shut down, we built the new themes using the [Azurra framework by B00merang](http://github.com/Elbullazul/Azurra_framework).

The Brilliance bundle consists of the following themes:

- Brilliance Light (formerly Radiance Flat)
- Brilliance Darker (formerly Ambiance Flat)
- Brilliance Dark (formerly Ambiance Blackout Flat)

We also plan on restoring the following at some point in the future:

- Ambiance colors (12 colors)
- Radiance colors (12 colors)
- Ambiance Blackout colors (12 colors)
