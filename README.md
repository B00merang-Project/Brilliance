# Brilliance
(previously Ambiance Flat by RAVEfinity)

Originally, Ambiance and Radiance Flat were an modern and vivid re-imagination of the Ambiance and Radiance themes.
Once RAVEfinity shut down (uncertainty prestists to this day) and GNOME released a new version, these themes were incompatible for the newest CSS framework.

We have taken upon ourselves to restore at least some part of the original RAVEfinity project themes, starting with the Brilliance Pack, which includes Light, Dark and Darker variants, based on the original material.

With the flexibility that the Azurra framework allows, we've restored two variants so far:
- Ambiance Flat (13 colors)
- Ambiance Blackout Flat (13 colors)

and we're on our way to complete the following:
- Radiance Flat (13 colors)
- Vivacious (14 colors)
- Vivacious Dark (14 colors)

Once we achieve an Ambiance clone based on the Azurra framework, we will be able to completely restore RAVEfinity's work:
- Ambiance colors (14 colors)
- Radiance colors (14 colors)
- Ambiance Blackout colors (14 colors)
